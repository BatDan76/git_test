Testing adding text to a file and then staging and ultimately commiting to repo
Trying it on my own this time without looking at curriculum
Will this still show up if I don't use the -m command?
Another Test
Why not showing up?
Should work this time, -m is for commiting not pushing
Testing yet again
Final Test before bed
One last Test
Recapping my knowledge from yesterday
